Villager pathfinding on dirt paths is improved, inventories expanded to 10 slots, and they run slightly faster to escape monsters. Craft Hopper Markers and Farmer Guide Stones at the Crafting Table. To enable crop storage, place a Farmer Guide Stone near a hopper and a Hopper Marker on top of the hopperâ€”farmers will drop excess crops there. By MRxSIR.",
