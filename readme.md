## Development Notes

### 2. Naming Conventions
- lowercase and underscores
  - e.g. `lumberjack` or `do_the_thing`

### 3. Methodology for alterations
- use custom files where possible and override some things, such as `villager_v2.behavior.json`, with as few alterations as possible to maintain compatibility and stability. 
- keep it kosher/vanilla for the most part.
