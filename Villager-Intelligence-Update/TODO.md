When sharing to hopper marker component is added, it overwrites the default one and when share to hopper marker component is removed, the default one is still gone. So...

- need to re-add the default one everytime share to marker is done, or
- see if they can co-exist somehow

* investigate if inventory is cleared everytime shareables is removed.
