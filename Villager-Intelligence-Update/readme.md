## Villager Intelligence Update (Helpful Villagers)
- Renaming with nametags enabled
- Inventory size increased to 10
- Using a chest, click on a villager to enable/disable inventory access.

### Farmer
- Make a farmer follow you while holding a chest. Toggle on/off by clicking farmer with chest.
- Farmer can drop crops to hopper:
  1. During work time, farmer has the chance to look for a "farmer guide stone"...
  2. If a Guide Stone is found, farmer will go to it then share to a nearby "hopper marker" entity that should be placed on top of a hopper and within sight of the Farmer Guide Stone.
  3. Farmer will share **excess crops** from his inventory to it and go back to normal activities.
